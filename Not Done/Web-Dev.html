				<p>Do Start with HTML(Hypertext Markup Language).I think that's the easy way to motivate you to go and continue your own path(Web-Dev-At Beginner's Level).In this language we will learn about linking and div and structure,structure,structure.If you go out with your friends for adventerous reason or just for chilling-out ,maybe you want to go to get some exprience and memorable moments about new places(eg.new Coffe /..),so you take a decision on location (Server(google ,duckduckgo,perplexity) via your browser )then places(based on html and URL ) then sitting down and analysing and enjoy the place you are at.So after all,HTML for raw structre ,CSS(Cascade Structure )for beutify your structure and practical orders and commands(electricity and lights of House) by Javascript(why this vs. PHP because that's modern and JSON (came from Javascript Concept not from PHP)</p>
