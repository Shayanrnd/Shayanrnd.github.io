<p>My Name is Shayan(You can call me Shayanrnd(Rahiminezhad:LastName).<br>
I am Persian, from Iran with honor🇮🇷.</p>
<p>I graduated with Doctorate Veterinary medicine (D.Vm) from Science and Research branch of Islamic Azad University and be a datascientist enthusiast and try to approach DataScience with my Domain Knowledge which revolves around veterinary datasets and so on …(i don’t want to go further in details)</p>
<h1 id="story-of-my-life-">**Story of My life **</h1>
<p>Recently, I decided to ignore everything because I believed that clinging to unfeasible ideas that people explore ( called Instagram-Loop) makes it easier for people to function in life and work.<br>
Along this path, I tried to suppress my emotions and disconnect from my past—which was, of course, incredibly difficult. (Anyone who’s gone through something similar would understand!)</p>
<p>Then, after burning out at work—without even engaging with it or society—I began questioning myself: <em>Am I antisocial? Or something even worse?</em></p>
<p>I started analyzing how my brain works, and I realized something: <strong>We think in layers of interconnected, graph-like structures, 24/7.</strong> This idea blew my mind, and I dove deeper, trying to understand how everything in life connects. I explored relentlessly, but I couldn’t handle it. The more I exposed myself to these thoughts, the more overwhelmed I became. I felt like I was losing my sanity—struggling to breathe under the weight of responsibilities, impulses, and endless emotions. I cried. A lot.</p>
<p>After some time, I went out with my girlfriend, and during our conversation, I had an epiphany. The root of my struggles traced back to my childhood, when I was just 2 or 3 years old. They(therapist) said :(A single word defined my existence: <strong>Fear</strong>—fear of change, fear of disrupting my life even slightly. That fear kept me from truly living, from enjoying anything.)<br>
But i was thinking if i found that root why again is it to hard for me to living life ? i have to tell you some of expriences in my life and try to convince you "how hard would it be if we cannot find our mental problem(why? let’s imagine just catastrophic events that grip you emotionally (for me Charlie Kirk’s Assasination).<br>
Based on Wikipedia i listed some signs</p>
<ol>
<li>Anxiety</li>
<li>Depression</li>
<li>Social Isolation</li>
<li>Social Interaction</li>
<li>Suicidality</li>
<li>try to over-Organize everything</li>
<li>Sanity in Multitasking even one probelems</li>
<li>Agitation</li>
<li>Stagnant</li>
<li>Impulsivity</li>
<li>Consumption a lot instead of Personalized them or build something</li>
</ol>
<p>Which is me ! Goodbye ! Next person to find ! But But one of the thing that i have to tell you it’s  magic from God for me it’s like a abillity genetic abillity to see everything- from one inlet that’s burden for normal people! (Neurodivergence is a gift from the God!)</p>
<p>I kept searching for my own path, reading thousands of books (10,000, maybe?)&amp; i quietly continue that path.</p>
<p>So I share with you everything i expriences in this fucking chaotic life (but advanterous(meaning of life)</p>
<p>Now, this is my space—a place to share my thoughts. For me, it’s about <strong>optimizing how I share</strong>, whether on social media or within a community.</p>
