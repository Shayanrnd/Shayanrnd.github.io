<p>My full name is Shayan Rahimi Nezhad. I am Persian, from Iran ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡·.</p>
<p>Recently, I decided to ignore everything because I believed that clinging to unfeasible ideas makes it easier for people to function in life and work. Along this path, I tried to suppress my emotions and disconnect from my pastâ€”which was, of course, incredibly difficult. (Anyone whoâ€™s gone through something similar would understand!)</p>
<p>Then, after burning out at workâ€”without even engaging with it or societyâ€”I began questioning myself: <em>Am I antisocial? Or something even worse?</em></p>
<p>I started analyzing how my brain works, and I realized something: <strong>We think in layers of interconnected, graph-like structures, 24/7.</strong> This idea blew my mind, and I dove deeper, trying to understand how everything in life connects. I explored relentlessly, but I couldnâ€™t handle it. The more I exposed myself to these thoughts, the more overwhelmed I became. I felt like I was losing my sanityâ€”struggling to breathe under the weight of responsibilities, impulses, and endless emotions. I cried. A lot.</p>
<p>After some time, I went out with my girlfriend, and during our conversation, I had an epiphany. The root of my struggles traced back to my childhood, when I was just 2 or 3 years old. A single word defined my existence: <strong>Fear</strong>â€”fear of change, fear of disrupting my life even slightly. That fear kept me from truly living, from enjoying anything. Instead, I kept searching for my own path, reading thousands of books (10,000, maybe?) without ever applying their lessons or personalizing them.</p>
<p>Now, this is my spaceâ€”a place to share my thoughts. For me, itâ€™s about <strong>optimizing how I share</strong>, whether on social media or within a community.</p>
